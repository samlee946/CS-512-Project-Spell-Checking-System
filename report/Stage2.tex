\textnormal{
Transform the project requirements into a system flow diagram, specifyng the different algorithms, data types and structures required for processing and their associated operations.  
The deliverables for this stage include the system flow diagram containing a graphical representation and  textual descriptions of the corresponding data trasnformations, high level pseudo code of the overall system operation, and overall system time and space complexity.}

%\begin{itemize} 
%\item{ }
%A brief textual description of the overall flow diagram (along with its functional operation in the different user scenarios described in the first stage of the project).
%\item{ }
%A specification of each algorithm and associated data structures together with its entities, attributes, and operations ( include an English description of how they relate to your user scenario(s)).

%\end{itemize}

\item{ Flow Diagram. }
Please insert your system Flow Diagram here.
\item{ High Level Pseudo Code System Description. }
Please insert high level pseudo-code describing the major system modules as per your flow diagram.
\item{Algorithms and  Data Structures. }
Please insert a brief description of each major Algorithm and its associated data structures here.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize} 
\item{  Flow Diagram Major Constraints.}
Please insert here the integrity constraints:
\begin{itemize} 
\item{ Integrity Constraint. }
